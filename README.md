# 10_Capstone_Project

The goal of this exercise is to create a product to highlight the prediction algorithm that you have built and to provide an interface that can be accessed by others. For this project you must submit:

- A Shiny app that takes as input a phrase (multiple words) in a text box input and outputs a prediction of the next word.

- A slide deck consisting of no more than 5 slides created with R Studio Presenter (https://support.rstudio.com/hc/en-us/articles/200486468-Authoring-R-Presentations) pitching your algorithm and app as if you were presenting to your boss or an investor.

The repository contains all the source codes for the Capstone project: ui.R, server.R and Capstone_project.RPRES. 
The key deliverables are the following: 

- A Shiny application has been created and deployed on Rstudio's servers, which is available by the link: https://elfedorova.shinyapps.io/Word_predictor/

- Areproducible pitch presentation about the application has been created with help of Rstudio Presenter, which is available by the  link on RPubs: http://rpubs.com/elfedorova/436221
